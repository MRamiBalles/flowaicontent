## 1. Executive Summary: The Dual Monetization Model

FlowAI disrupts the traditional "extraction-based" social media model (where platforms keep 100% of ad revenue) by implementing a **Dual Monetization Model**. This system aligns incentives between the platform, creators, and viewers.

### Core Philosophy
- **Creators** are paid for quality content, not just views.
- **Viewers** are compensated for their attention (Proof of Attention).
- **Platform** takes a fair cut (SaaS + Marketplace fees) to sustain growth.

### B. Marketplace Commissions (20% of Revenue)
Transaction fees from the digital asset economy.

1.  **Style Packs Marketplace**:
    - Creators design and sell custom AI visual styles (LoRA adapters).

2.  **NFT Marketplace**:
    - Viral videos can be minted as NFTs and traded.
    - **Fee**: 5% commission on initial sale + 2.5% on secondary royalties.

### C. Token Economy Fees (10% of Revenue)

1.  **Fiat On-Ramp**: 1% fee when users buy $FLOW with credit cards.
2.  **Cash-Out**: 3% fee when creators withdraw earnings to bank accounts.
3.  **Staking Unstake**: 0.5% early unstake fee (burned).

## 3. Creator Economics

### How Creators Earn
1.  **Direct Tipping**: Viewers can tip $FLOW tokens directly on videos. (0% platform fee).
2.  **Engagement Pool**: Daily pool of $FLOW distributed based on "Quality Engagement" score (Watch time x Interaction rate).
3.  **Asset Sales**: Selling prompts, style packs, or video templates in the marketplace.

### Earning Potential (Estimates)
- **Micro-Influencer (10k followers)**: ~$500/mo (Tips + Pool)
- **Pro Creator (100k followers)**: ~$5,000/mo (SaaS + Marketplace Sales)
- **Top Tier (1M+ followers)**: ~$50,000/mo (Brand deals + Enterprise contracts)

## 4. Viewer Economics: Proof of Attention (PoA)

### How It Works
Instead of showing ads for free, we share ad revenue with viewers via $FLOW tokens.

- **Rate**: Earn ~5 $FLOW per hour of active watching.
- **Validation**: "Active watching" is verified by:
    - Mouse movement/scroll patterns.
    - Periodic "Are you still watching?" checks.
    - Biometric verification (optional for higher rates).

### Utility for Viewers
Viewers use earned $FLOW to:
- Tip favorite creators.
- Buy "Boosts" to promote their own content.
- Purchase Premium subscriptions (discounted rate).
- Stake for governance rights.

## 5. Pricing Strategy & Psychology

### The "Creator Ladder"
We design our pricing to move users up the ladder:
1.  **Hook**: Free tier allows experimentation.
2.  **Convert**: Watermarks and daily limits push serious users to PRO ($20 is an impulse buy price point).
3.  **Scale**: As creators grow teams, BUSINESS tier becomes essential.

### Anchor Pricing
- We position the **PRO ($20)** tier as the "Best Value" anchor.
- Compared to Adobe Premiere ($20.99/mo) + Stock Footage ($30/mo) + AI Tools ($20/mo), FlowAI at $20/mo is a "no-brainer".
