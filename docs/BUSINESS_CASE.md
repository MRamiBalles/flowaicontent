### Competitive Moats (Defensibility)

#### 1. **Network Effects** (Strong)
```
As FlowAI grows:
├─ More creators → More content → More viewers
├─ More viewers → Higher creator earnings → More creators
├─ More sales → More Style Packs → Better selection
└─ More token holders → Higher liquidity → Lower volatility

Switching Cost: High (audience, earnings history, tokens)
```

#### 2. **Proprietary Data & Models** (Medium)
```
Unique Datasets:
• 100k+ user-generated prompts
• Click-through rates on styles
• Viral video patterns
• Engagement heuristics

Custom LoRA Models:

```

#### 3. **Token Ecosystem Lock-In** (Medium-Strong)
```
Once users hold $FLOW:
├─ Staking rewards (31% APY) → Opportunity cost to leave
├─ NFT purchases → Sunk cost fallacy
├─ Earned tokens → Endowment effect
└─ Community governance → Voice/ownership

Competitor Challenge: Can't launch token retroactively without regulatory risk
```

#### 4. **Brand & Community** (Weak → Strong over time)
```
Today: Early-stage, building
Year 2: Recognized in AI creator circles
Year 3: Category leader ("FlowAI of video" like "Canva of design")

Strategies:
• Creator success stories (UGC marketing)
• Weekly creator spotlights
• Annual FlowCon conference (Year 3)
```

- **Probability**: High (70%)
- **Impact**: Low
- **Mitigation**: Differentiation via community and monetization features. Not competing on price alone.
