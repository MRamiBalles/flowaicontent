```

---

#### 2. Boosting Videos

**What is Boosting?**

**Pricing**:

```

**How to Boost**:

- Before announcements/launches

---

#### 3. Purchasing Marketplace Items

3. Platform fee: 20% (e.g., 1,000 FLO → $8 after fee)
4. Enter bank details (first time)
5. Receive USD in 2-5 business days

**Why 20% Fee?**
- Covers payment processing (~3%)
- Prevents arbitrage abuse
- Incentivizes spending in ecosystem

**Alternative**: Sell on Uniswap (1-3% fees, but requires crypto wallet)

---

## 🥩 Staking

### What is Staking?

**Staking** = Locking FLO tokens to earn rewards (like a savings account).

**Why Stake?**
- Earn passive income (15-31% APY)
- Support platform stability
- Reduce token velocity (benefits price)

---

### How to Stake

**Step 1: Choose Lock Period**
1. Go to **"Wallet"** → **"Staking"**
2. Select period:

| Lock Period | APY | Early Withdrawal Penalty |
|-------------|-----|--------------------------|
| **No Lock** | 15% | None |
| **3 Months** | 20% | 10% fee |
| **6 Months** | 25% | 15% fee |
| **12 Months** | 31% | 20% fee |

**Step 2: Enter Amount**
- Minimum: 100 FLO
- Maximum: No limit (but limited staking pool)

**Step 3: Confirm**
- Review details
- Click **"Stake"**
- Tokens locked immediately

---

### Staking Example

**Scenario**: Stake 10,000 FLO for 12 months at 31% APY

**Calculation**:
```
Principal:       10,000 FLO
APY:             31%
Duration:        12 months
Rewards:         3,100 FLO
Total after 1y:  13,100 FLO
```

**USD Value** (at $0.10/FLO):
```
Initial:  $1,000
Final:    $1,310
Profit:   $310 (31% return)
```

---

### Rewards Distribution

**How Rewards Work**:
- Rewards accrue daily
- Paid out weekly (every Monday)
- Compound automatically (unless you withdraw)

**Rewards Source**:
- 30% of platform revenue → staking pool
- Sustainable long-term (not a Ponzi)

**Staking Pool Cap**: 300M FLO (30% of total supply)

---

### Unstaking

**Withdraw Anytime** (if no lock period):
1. Go to **"Staking"**
2. Click **"Unstake"**
3. Tokens + rewards back to wallet

**Early Withdrawal** (if locked):
```
Example: 12-month lock, withdraw after 6 months
├─ Principal: 10,000 FLO (returned)
├─ Rewards earned: 1,550 FLO (50% of year)
├─ Penalty: 20% of principal = 2,000 FLO
└─ Net received: 10,000 + 1,550 - 2,000 = 9,550 FLO
```

**Tip**: Only stake amounts you won't need short-term!

---

### Risks & Considerations

**Token Price Volatility**:
- 31% APY in FLO ≠ guaranteed USD gains
- If FLO price drops 50%, you may lose money in USD terms
- Example: Stake $1,000, earn 31% → $1,310. But if FLO price drops 40%, now worth $786.

**Dilution**:
- If too many people stake, APY decreases (shared pool)
- Early stakers benefit most

**Opportunity Cost**:
- Locked tokens can't be used for other opportunities
- Consider market conditions before locking

**Platform Risk**:
- Smart contract bugs (mitigated by audits)
- Platform failure (unlikely but possible)

---
