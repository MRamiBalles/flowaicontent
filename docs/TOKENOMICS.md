# 💰 FlowAI - Tokenomics

> **$FLOW Token Economic Model & Distribution Strategy**  
> **Version**: 1.0  
> **Last Updated**: 2024  
> **Target Audience**: Investors, Token Holders, Community

---

## 📋 Executive Summary

The **$FLOW token** (FLO) is the native utility token powering the FlowAI creator economy. It enables a dual-sided marketplace where viewers earn tokens for attention (Proof of Attention) and creators earn tokens for content creation, with token utility spanning tipping, boosting, staking, and governance.

**Key Token Metrics**:
- **Token Standard**: ERC-20
- **Blockchain**: Polygon (PoS)
- **Total Supply**: 1,000,000,000 FLO (1 Billion)
- **Initial Circulating Supply**: 100,000,000 FLO (10%)
- **Token Generation Event (TGE)**: Q1 2025 (planned)
- **Initial Market Cap**: $1M @ $0.01/FLO
- **Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV)**: $10M

---

## 🎯 Token Utility

### Primary Use Cases

#### 1. 💸 **Tipping & Creator Support**
```
Viewer → Tip FLO → Creator
• Minimum tip: 10 FLO
• Creator keeps: 95% (5% platform fee)
• Use case: Support favorite creators directly
```

**Example**:
- User tips 100 FLO to creator
- Creator receives: 95 FLO
- Platform fee: 5 FLO
- Creator can cash out or reinvest in platform

---

#### 2. 🚀 **Boosting Content**
```
Creator → Spend FLO → Boost video visibility
• 50 FLO = 1,000 extra impressions
• 200 FLO = 5,000 extra impressions (20% discount)
• 500 FLO = 15,000 extra impressions (40% discount)
```

**Boost Algorithm**:
- Boosted videos appear higher in feed
- Shown to users with similar interests
- 48-hour boost duration
- ROI for creator: Typically 2-5x views

---

#### 3. 🔥 **Staking for Rewards**
```
Token Holder → Stake FLO → Earn Yield
• Base APY: 15% (paid in FLO)
• Max APY: 31% (with 12-month lock)
• Rewards source: Platform revenue (30% allocated)
```

**Staking Tiers**:
| Lock Period | APY | Early Withdrawal Penalty |
|-------------|-----|--------------------------|
| **No Lock** | 15% | None |
| **3 Months** | 20% | 10% fee |
| **6 Months** | 25% | 15% fee |
| **12 Months** | 31% | 20% fee |

**Staking Pool Cap**: 300M FLO (30% of total supply)

---

#### 4. 🛒 **Marketplace Purchases**
```
User → Spend FLO → Buy digital goods
• Style Packs: 50-500 FLO
• Custom LoRA models: 1,000-10,000 FLO
• NFT videos: 100-10,000 FLO
• Season Pass: 200 FLO/month
```

**Discount for FLO Payments**:
- 10% cheaper than fiat (e.g., $10 item = 90 FLO @ $0.10/FLO)
- Incentivizes token usage over credit card

---

#### 5. 🗳️ **Governance (Future)**
```
Token Holder → Vote on proposals
• 1 FLO = 1 vote (linear)
• Proposal threshold: 1M FLO (0.1% supply)
• Quorum: 10M FLO (1% supply)
```

**Governance Scope** (Year 2+):
- Feature prioritization
- Platform fee adjustments (within 3-7% range)
- Grant allocations (community fund)
- Partnership approvals (major integrations)

---

#### Post-TGE Projections

**Launch Price (TGE)**: $0.01/FLO
- **Initial Market Cap**: $2.65M (265M circulating × $0.01)
- **FDV**: $10M (1B total supply × $0.01)

**Year 1 Targets**:
```
Conservative: $0.05/FLO
├─ Market Cap:  $13.25M (265M circ)
├─ FDV:         $50M
├─ Comparable:  Audius (AUDIO) early stage

Base Case:      $0.10/FLO
├─ Market Cap:  $40.9M (409M circ at end of Year 2)
├─ FDV:         $100M
├─ Comparable:  Rally (RLY) at similar traction

Bullish:        $0.25/FLO
├─ Market Cap:  $102M (409M circ)
├─ FDV:         $250M
├─ Comparable:  Friend.tech (FRIEND) during hype cycle
```

**Year 3 Targets** (based on $12M ARR):
```
Token Price:    $0.50/FLO
├─ Market Cap:  $276M (553M circ)
├─ FDV:         $500M
├─ P/S Ratio:   41.7x (typical for growth crypto)
├─ Comparable:  Chiliz (CHZ), Flow (FLOW)
```

---

### Value Accrual Mechanisms

#### 1. **Buy Pressure** (Token Demand)
```
Sources:
├─ Fiat On-Ramp:     $50k/month (current) → 500k FLO/month @ $0.10
├─ Marketplace:      Users buy FLO to purchase style packs
├─ Staking:          Locked tokens reduce circulating supply
└─ Speculation:      Investors accumulate for price appreciation
```

#### 2. **Sell Pressure** (Token Supply)
```
Sources:
├─ Community Rewards:   6.67M FLO/month (viewers + creators)
├─ Team/Investor Vesting: 5M FLO/month (post-cliff)
├─ Cash-Out:            Creators selling earned FLO
└─ Liquidity Mining:    LP rewards (minimal)
```

#### 3. **Token Sinks** (Permanent Removal)
```
Burn Mechanisms:
├─ Platform Fees:       5% of tips burned quarterly
├─ Boost Purchases:     50% of FLO spent on boosts burned
├─ Failed Proposals:    Governance proposal deposits burned
│
Expected Burn Rate:     500k FLO/month (Year 1)
                       ↓
Deflationary Pressure:  ~6M FLO/year (0.6% of supply)
```

**Net Result**: Gradual decrease in circulating supply over time, increasing scarcity.

---

## 💧 Liquidity Strategy

### DEX Liquidity Pools

#### Uniswap V3 (Polygon)
```
Pair: FLO/USDC
Initial Liquidity: $500k
├─ FLO Side:  25M FLO ($250k @ $0.01)
└─ USDC Side: $250k

Fee Tier: 0.3% (standard)
Range: $0.005 - $0.02 (concentrated liquidity)

LP Providers:
├─ Treasury:  $300k (60%)
├─ Team:      $100k (20%)
└─ Community: $100k (20%, incentivized with 2M FLO rewards)
```

**Slippage Targets**:
- $1k trade: <1% slippage
- $10k trade: <5% slippage
- $100k trade: >10% slippage (discouraged, use OTC)

---

#### Quickswap (Polygon)
```
Pair: FLO/MATIC
Initial Liquidity: $200k
├─ FLO Side:  10M FLO ($100k)
└─ MATIC Side: $100k

Purpose: Provide alternative trading route, reduce FLO/USDC pressure
```

---

### Centralized Exchange Listings

**Tier 3 CEXs** (Year 1):
- Gate.io, MEXC, Bitget
- Listing cost: $50k-$100k each
- Volume: $100k-$500k daily

**Tier 2 CEXs** (Year 2):
- Kraken, Coinbase (if Polygon supported)
- Listing cost: $200k-$500k + legal/compliance
- Volume: $1M-$5M daily

**Tier 1 CEXs** (Year 3+):
- Binance, Coinbase Pro
- Listing cost: $500k-$1M + token lockup
- Volume: $10M+ daily

**Rationale for Delayed CEX Listings**:
- Build community + product first (avoid pump & dump)
- DEX liquidity sufficient for early stage
- CEX listings provide marketing boost when ready

---

### Market Making

**Partner**: Wintermute or B2C2 (institutional MM)

**Agreement Terms**:
- Loan: 20M FLO (2% of supply)
- Duration: 12 months
- Fee: 0.5% of trading volume
- Spread target: <1% bid-ask

**Objectives**:
- Maintain liquidity during low-volume periods
- Prevent flash crashes
- Provide orderly market for large trades

---

## 🛡️ Token Security & Compliance

### Smart Contract Security

**Audits**:
1. **CertiK** (Q4 2024): $50k
   - Scope: FloToken.sol, FlowStaking.sol
   - Status: Pending
2. **OpenZeppelin** (Q1 2025): $75k
   - Scope: Full contract suite + governance
   - Status: Scheduled

**Bug Bounty**: $100k pool (Immunefi)
- Critical: $50k
- High: $20k
- Medium: $5k

---

### Regulatory Compliance

**Legal Opinion**: Token is a **Utility Token**, not a security (Howey Test analysis)

**Rationale**:
1. ✅ **Utility-first**: Primary purpose is platform usage (tipping, boosting, purchasing)
2. ✅ **No profit expectation promise**: We do not guarantee returns
3. ✅ **Decentralized governance**: Community controls protocol (Year 2+)
4. ⚠️ **Risk**: Early investors may view as investment (mitigated by strong utility)

**Geographic Restrictions**:
- ❌ **United States**: No token sale (Reg D exemption for accredited investors only)
- ❌ **China, North Korea**: Prohibited
- ✅ **EU, UK, LATAM, Asia (ex-China)**: Allowed

**KYC/AML**: Required for purchases >$1k (Stripe Identity)

---

## 📊 Economic Modeling

### Token Velocity

**Velocity Formula**: `V = GDP / M` (where GDP = transaction volume, M = market cap)

**Assumptions** (Year 2):
- Transaction Volume: $10M/year (tips, boosts, purchases)
- Market Cap: $40M (409M FLO × $0.10)
- Velocity: 0.25 (low = good for price)

**Velocity Reduction Strategies**:
1. **Staking**: Locks 30% of supply
2. **Long-term hodling**: Investor vesting + team lock-ups
3. **Burning**: Reduces circulating supply over time
4. **Speculation**: Traders hold for appreciation

**Target Velocity**: <1.0 (indicates healthy holding behavior)

---

### Supply & Demand Model

**Demand Drivers** (Year 2):
```
Monthly Token Demand:
├─ Fiat On-Ramp:      $50k → 500k FLO
├─ Marketplace:       $20k → 200k FLO
├─ Staking Inflows:   $30k → 300k FLO
└─ Speculation:       $100k → 1M FLO
Total Buy Pressure:   2M FLO/month
```

**Supply Inflows** (Year 2):
```
Monthly Token Supply:
├─ Community Rewards: 6.67M FLO
├─ Vesting Unlocks:   8.56M FLO (investors + team)
├─ Creator Cash-Outs: 1M FLO
Total Sell Pressure:  16.23M FLO/month
```

**Net Pressure**: -14.23M FLO/month (bearish without intervention)

**Mitigation**:
- Increase buy pressure via marketing (more users = more demand)
- Increase token utility (more use cases = less selling)
- Burn mechanisms (reduce effective supply)

---

### Break-Even Price

**Question**: What token price makes FlowAI self-sustaining?

**Calculation**:
```
Monthly Platform Costs: $80k (team + infra)
Monthly Revenue:        $150k (MRR in Year 2)
Net Cash Flow:          +$70k (profitable)

Token Revenue Needed:   $0 (already profitable in fiat)

Therefore:
Break-Even Price:       $0 (no dependence on token sales)
```

**Key Insight**: FlowAI is revenue-generating in fiat (SaaS model). Token is a growth accelerator, not a survival mechanism. This is **critical** for investor confidence.

---

## 🚀 Go-To-Market Strategy

### Pre-TGE (Months -3 to 0)

**Objectives**:
- Build hype + community
- Educate on tokenomics
- Secure initial liquidity

**Tactics**:
1. **Token Whitepaper** (this doc): Published + promoted
2. **Community AMAs**: Weekly Twitter Spaces + Discord
3. **KOL Partnerships**: Pay 10-20 crypto influencers ($5k-$20k each)
4. **Whitelist Campaign**: First 1,000 users get bonus 100 FLO at TGE
5. **Pre-Sale (if needed)**: Raise $500k from community @ $0.008/FLO

---

### TGE & Launch (Month 0)

**Day of TGE**:
- **Morning**: Deploy contracts + audit report published
- **Noon**: Open Uniswap liquidity pool (FLO/USDC)
- **Afternoon**: Enable trading + fiat on-ramp
- **Evening**: Launch party (virtual event, 1k+ attendees)

**Launch Metrics to Track**:
- Trading volume (target: $100k Day 1)
- Unique holders (target: 500 Day 1)
- Price stability (target: $0.01 ± 20%)

---

### Post-TGE (Months 1-12)

**Objectives**:
- Maintain price stability
- Grow holder base
- Increase utility adoption

**Tactics**:
1. **Liquidity Mining**: 2M FLO/month to LP providers (6 months)
2. **Airdrop Campaigns**: 500 FLO to each user who generates 10+ videos
3. **CEX Listings**: Target 2-3 Tier 3 exchanges by Month 6
4. **Partnerships**: Integrate with 3-5 Web3 platforms (e.g., Lens Protocol, Farcaster)
5. **Buyback Program**: Use 10% of revenue to buy FLO from market (burns afterward)

---
